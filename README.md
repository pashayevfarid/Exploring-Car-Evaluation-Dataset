# Exploring-Car-Evaluation-Dataset: Analysis Using Data Mining Techniques

This is my data mining project report focused on the Car Evaluation Dataset. This project aims to provide a detailed analysis of car attributes and performance using various data mining techniques.
The report covers data preprocessing, pattern mining, and classification tasks to predict car acceptability based on the mined patterns.

This project offers valuable insights for car manufacturers, dealerships, and consumers by applying data mining techniques to enhance decision-making processes and improve car evaluation procedures.

****1. Data Preprocessing****

  Exploring dataset structure and characteristics
  
  Encoding categorical variables
  
  Addressing class imbalance

****2. Pattern Mining****

  Utilizing Apriori, Eclat, FP-Growth, and PrefixSpan algorithms
  
  Extracting frequent patterns and association rules
  
  Insights into relationships between car attributes and acceptability ratings

****3. Classification Task****

  Before Mining: Random Forest Classifier for baseline prediction
  
  After Mining: Optimized techniques for improved model performance
  
  Feature selection and hyperparameter tuning

****4.Results****

  Evaluation metrics such as ROC AUC score, Gini score, accuracy, and confusion matrix
  
  Comparison of classification results before and after pattern mining

****How to Use****

  **1.** Download the provided dataset 'Car Evaluation Dataset'.
  
  **2.** Run the data preprocessing steps to prepare the dataset for analysis.
  
  **3.** Implement pattern mining algorithms (Apriori, Eclat, FP-Growth, PrefixSpan) to extract     
         frequent patterns.
  
  **4.** Develop a classification model using Random Forest Classifier to predict car 
         acceptability.
  
  **5.** Evaluate the model performance using various metrics and compare results before and 
         after pattern mining.
